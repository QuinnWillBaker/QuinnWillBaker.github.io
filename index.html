what is going on?

Dr. Seuss/Quotes
You have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes. You can steer yourself any direction you choose.
Today you are you! That is truer than true! There is no one alive who is you-er than you!
Don't cry because it's over. Smile because it happened.
A person's a person, no matter how small.
The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you'll go.
Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better. It's not.
Sometimes the questions are complicated and the answers are simple.
Fantasy is a necessary ingredient in living, it's a way of looking at life through the wrong end of a telescope.
Be who you are and say what you feel, because those who mind don't matter and those who matter don't mind.
If you never did, you should. These things are fun and fun is good!
